# Chess-Game

chess game project that I have recently completed. In this project, 
I developed a web-based chess game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The objective of the game is to provide users with an interactive and challenging chess-playing experience.

Tools Used:

HTML
CSS
JavaScript
Font Awesome library
The project involved several key aspects:

Chessboard Creation: I implemented the creation of an 8x8 chessboard using HTML and CSS.
Each square on the board was given a unique identifier to facilitate the movement of pieces.
Piece Placement: The initial placement of chess pieces was set according to the standard chess rules using JavaScript.
Each piece was assigned its corresponding Unicode character.
Drag and Drop Functionality: I incorporated drag and drop functionality to enable players to move the chess pieces on the board.
This feature was implemented using JavaScript event listeners and DOM manipulation.
Valid Move Validation: One of the most complex aspects of the project was determining the valid moves for each chess piece.
Despite extensive research and efforts, I encountered challenges in finding the optimal algorithm to validate the legality of each move based on the rules of chess. 
As a result, the game may not guarantee strictly valid moves at this stage.

While the game provides an interactive chess-playing experience, it is important to note that the move validation
algorithm may not cover all edge cases or strictly adhere to the rules of chess.
The current implementation should be seen as a work in progress, and further refinement would be required
to ensure complete adherence to the rules.
